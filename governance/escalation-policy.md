\# Governance Escalation Policy



\## Purpose



This policy defines \*\*how operational issues escalate from day-to-day execution to governance decision-making\*\*.



The goal is to:

\- Resolve incidents at the lowest effective level

\- Prevent unnecessary governance intervention

\- Ensure high-risk decisions are reviewed transparently



Escalation is about \*\*decision authority\*\*, not blame.



---



\## Escalation Philosophy



\- Most issues are operational, not governance problems

\- Governance exists to resolve \*\*irreversible or credibility-impacting decisions\*\*

\- Delayed escalation is more dangerous than early escalation



---



\## Escalation Levels



\### Level 0 – Normal Operations

Handled entirely by Ops.



Examples:

\- Minor oracle delays

\- Low-impact disputes

\- Temporary liquidity imbalance



No governance involvement.



---



\### Level 1 – Ops Escalation (Internal)



Triggered when:

\- Issue persists beyond defined thresholds

\- Risk impact grows

\- Automation cannot resolve it



Actions:

\- Senior Ops review

\- Incident log created

\- Monitoring frequency increased



---



\### Level 2 – Governance Notification



Triggered when:

\- Resolution outcome may be disputed

\- Market credibility is at risk

\- User funds may be affected



Actions:

\- Governance informed

\- Preliminary recommendation prepared

\- No irreversible actions taken



---



\### Level 3 – Governance Decision Required



Triggered when:

\- Market invalidation is possible

\- Oracle outcome is disputed

\- Settlement logic must change

\- Extended pause is required



Actions:

\- Formal escalation submitted

\- Governance vote or approval required

\- Ops execution frozen pending decision



---



\## Escalation Triggers



\### Operational Triggers

\- Oracle heartbeat breach

\- Data inconsistency

\- Abnormal market behavior

\- Repeated incident recurrence



\### Market Triggers

\- Extreme pricing divergence

\- Thin liquidity during critical events

\- Manipulation indicators



\### Legal / Reputational Triggers

\- Ambiguous market wording

\- External challenge to outcome

\- Media or regulatory attention



---



\## Escalation Submission Requirements



Each escalation must include:

\- Incident summary

\- Affected markets

\- Timeline of events

\- Evidence and data sources

\- Risk assessment

\- Recommended actions



Incomplete escalations delay decisions.



---



\## Governance Response SLAs



| Severity | Response Time |

|---|---|

| Informational | 24–48 hours |

| High Risk | <12 hours |

| Critical | <4 hours |



Governance delay is itself an operational risk.



---



\## Decision Outcomes



Governance may:

\- Approve Ops recommendation

\- Request additional data

\- Modify resolution logic

\- Invalidate market

\- Mandate system changes



All decisions are final and auditable.



---



\## Communication Rules



\- Users are informed \*\*after\*\* governance decisions

\- Messaging must be factual, not speculative

\- Internal disagreement stays internal



Credibility is preserved by clarity, not speed.



---



\## Accountability



\- Ops owns escalation quality

\- Governance owns decision quality

\- Post-incident reviews are mandatory



Repeated escalations on similar issues trigger system redesign.



---



\## Key Principle



Escalation is not failure — \*\*failure is hiding risk until it explodes\*\*.



Strong platforms escalate early, decide clearly, and execute cleanly.
